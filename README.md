The Billiard Game
=================
The Billiard Game was developed as part of the course TNM085 at Link√∂ping University.

To run the project, place all of the files in a folder within your web server directory and then load the index.html file.

The project is required to being run via a web server, since it loads some of the files dynamically, which isn't always supported when opening the index.html directly from an arbitrary folder.
